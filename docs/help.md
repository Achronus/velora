# Help

This chapter focuses on steps you can take when encountering errors while using Velora.

The easiest way to get help is to create a ticket on [GitHub [:material-arrow-right-bottom:]](https://github.com/Achronus/velora/issues).

Currently we have no set policy or format for tickets. All that we ask is that you give us some information about the problem you are experiencing and the code you are using so we can try and reproduce the error and debug it accordingly ðŸ˜Š.
