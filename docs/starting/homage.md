# Homage

Velora comes packed with a variety of packages and builds on a wealth of knowledge that have been fundamental to its creation.

This page acts as a homage to show our :heart: and appreciation for the libraries and researchers that have helped make its packages possible.

## Packages

## Research Papers

We are thankful for a **LOT** of researchers in the RL space, more than we can count! ðŸ˜…

While their names are not mentioned here, their papers are outlined throughout the documentation accompanied with the algorithm implementations associated to their work.

Instead, we want to dedicate this section to some special mentions that the framework centres around: *Liquid Neural Networks* and *Neural Circuit Policies*.

### Liquid Neural Networks
