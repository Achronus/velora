# Saving & Loading Models

Saving a trained model and loading it are extremely common and useful practices when performing multiple experiments.

Both are really easy to do with our API and work identically for all agents.

Simply, select an agent you want to train, save it with it's instance `save` method and then `load` it with the agent class method.

For our example, we'll use [`LiquidDDPG`](../tutorial/agents/ddpg.md).

## Saving a Model

To save a model we use the model instance's `save` method:

```python
from velora.models import LiquidDDPG
from velora.utils import set_seed, set_device

import gymnasium as gym

set_seed(64)
device = set_device()

env = gym.make("InvertedPendulum-v5")

model = LiquidDDPG(4, 10, 1, device=device)
model.train(env, 128, n_episodes=10, window_size=5)

model.save('checkpoints/ddpg-InvertedPendulum/ep10')
```

This code should work 'as is'.

The only thing we need to do is give it a `dirpath` where the last folder contains all the models state files. These include:

- `metadata.json` - contains the model and optimizer metadata.
- `model_state.safetensors` - contains the model weights and biases.
- `optim_state.safetensors` - contains the optimizer states (actor and critic).

Optionally, we can also save the buffer state with `buffer=True`:

- `buffer_state.safetensors` - contains the buffer state.
- `metadata.json` - extended to include the `buffer` metadata.

```python
model.save('checkpoints/ddpg-InvertedPendulum/ep10', buffer=True)
```

And/or, optionally, the model config with `config=True` (stored in the `dirpath.parent`):

- `model_config.json` - contains the core details of the agent.

```python
model.save('checkpoints/ddpg-InvertedPendulum/ep10', config=True)
```

??? question "Why the parent directory?"

    The `model_config.json` contains comprehensive details about the agent. It never changes. Therefore, it should only be saved once.

    Typically, you'll save a model state during the training process after `n_episodes` (just like we do with the [SaveCheckpoints](../tutorial/callback.md#model-checkpoints) callback).

    The file is only used to provide an overview of the model so you can easily identify an experiment without having manually load a model's state. So, we store it above the `target` directory with the assumption that you are saving more than once for the same experiment.

Notice how we are using [safetensors [:material-arrow-right-bottom:]](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors). This helps us maximize tensor security and performance! ðŸ˜‰

## Loading a Model

To load a model we use the `load` class method:

```python
from velora.models import LiquidDDPG

model = LiquidDDPG.load('checkpoints/ddpg-InvertedPendulum/ep10')
```

Like before, the only thing we need to do is give it a `dirpath`. The complete model state will then be loaded into a new model instance.

Again, we don't load the buffers state by default. `buffer=True` will do that.

```python
model = LiquidDDPG.load(
    'checkpoints/ddpg-InvertedPendulum/ep10',
    buffer=True,
)
```

???+ Warning "Buffer Loading"

    Buffer's can only be loaded if they have previously been saved with the same model state.

    The load method checks for a `buffer_state.safetensors` and a `metadata.json` file with the `buffer` metadata.

Next, we'll start looking at each agent individually, starting with `DDPG`! ðŸš€
