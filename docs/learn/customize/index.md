# Customization - User Guide

This tutorial series shows you how to create your own algorithms using Velora's building blocks, such as the `Wiring`, `ReplayBuffer`, `DDPGActor`, and `DDPGCritic` classes.

While we offer predefined algorithms, sometimes you need more flexibility or may want to explore and create your own. In fact, we encourage it! 😁

So, to help you do that we've deliberately made it easy to plug-and-play with any of our classes in the framework. As long as you know how they work of course! 😉

Firstly, we'll start off with the `Wiring` class and then move onto Liquid Networks and other utility classes.
