# Theory

This chapter focuses on the theory of the algorithms used throughout the framework.

Each section provides details about a different algorithm, explaining how they work from a mathematical and visual perspective using diagrams.

We assume you already have a basic understand on the RL basics so that we can focus on the relevant aspects (this may change in the future).
